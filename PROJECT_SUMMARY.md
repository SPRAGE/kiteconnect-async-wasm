- ✅ Conditional compilation for different targets
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with `anyhow`
- ✅ Modern Rust 2021 edition patterns

### 3. **Testing Infrastructure**
- ✅ 15 comprehensive unit tests
- ✅ File-based mocking with JSON/CSV responses
- ✅ Async test patterns with `tokio::test`
- ✅ All tests passing reliably

### 4. **Documentation & Developer Experience**

- ✅ Fixed all doctest issues
- ✅ Created automated documentation generation script
- ✅ Clean examples with async patterns

### 5. **Workspace Cleanup & Ticker Removal**
- ✅ Removed outdated files and migration documents
- ✅ **Completely removed WebSocket/Ticker functionality**
- ✅ Clean project structure focused on REST API only
- ✅ Removed unnecessary WebSocket dependencies
- ✅ Updated documentation to reflect REST-only focus
- ✅ Working examples
- ✅ Automated tooling

## 🚀 Key Features

### **REST API Only - Focused & Lightweight**
- ✅ `reqwest::Client` shared safely across threads
- ✅ Connection pooling for optimal performance
- ✅ Full async/await support
- ✅ No WebSocket dependencies - cleaner build

### **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- ✅ Native (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- ✅ WASM (Browser environments)

### **Production Ready**
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ All REST API endpoints implemented
- ✅ Modern Rust patterns
- ✅ Well-documented codebase

## 📖 Documentation

- **Local Docs**: `doc/kiteconnect/index.html` (generated to root doc/ folder)
- **Generate Docs**: `./scripts/generate-docs.sh`
- **Run Tests**: `cargo test`
- **Build Examples**: `cargo build --examples`

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

The library is now a focused REST API client, production-ready. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Add request rate limiting for API compliance
2. **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
3. **Connection Pooling**: Advanced HTTP client configuration
4. **Metrics**: Add instrumentation for monitoring

## 💯 Test Results

All 15 tests passing:
- ✅ Basic functionality tests
- ✅ URL building and authentication
- ✅ API endpoint tests with mocked responses
- ✅ Async pattern validation
- ✅ Documentation tests

The KiteConnect Rust library is now a focused, lightweight REST API client - fully modernized, well-tested, and ready for production use! 🎉
